## Surf through the efficiency of development with Wave Shell, where each line of code is a wave of productivity.


Wave Shell was chosen to represent the dynamics and fluidity we aim to offer to developers. Just like ocean waves, we want every interaction with Wave Shell to be smooth and potentially powerful, providing a development experience as natural as riding a wave. The choice of the name reflects our vision for a CLI tool that allows developers to navigate easily through the development process, maintaining efficiency and positive energy in their daily work.
